# Email Client

Description:


A very interesting and simple front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails. 

In this project, back-end was handled using Django while front-end in JavaScript and HTML. 

I created APIs that lets user to Send, Receive and also Archieve emails. By clicking,Unarchieve in Archieved sections, user can even send the email back to Inbox.
